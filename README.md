## Purpose of the repository
In this repository I'm posting algorithms exercices (mostly found on [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard)) and my differents solutions.

## How i achieve it
My goal is to write the code with pure function like in the functional programming approach, to do that i use a lot map, filter and reduce function instead of for loop for exemple, I like this programming paradigm because it's reduces the likelihood of having bugs or side-effect since itâ€™s not going to mutate variables, I also noticed that react and especially his redux library use a lot this approach.
