## Goal of the repository
In this repository I'm posting algorithms exercices (mostly found on [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard)) and my differents solutions.

## How i achieve it
My goal is to use at most the functional programming approach by writing the code with pure functions, to do that I use higher order functions like map, filter and reduce function instead of for loop for example, I'm using this programming paradigm because it's reduces the likelihood of having bugs or side-effect since it’s not going to mutate variables, I also noticed library like [redux](https://redux.js.org/) use mostly this immutability concept.

## Definition
* [Pure Function](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pure-functions-in-javascript/) is a function that always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed. It does not depend on any state, or data change during a program’s execution rather it only depends on its input arguments. They are adored for their simplicity and testability.
* [Higher Orders Functions](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/higher-order-functions-in-javascript-examples/) are functions that perform operations on other functions.
